# Lena-Utils
A Lua Script to enhance the User's Gameplay. My first Script for Stand. More or less a Hobby I partake in every few days.

# Installation
To install, simply click "Download ZIP" and extract the .zip file. Copy and paste everything into the "%AppData%\Roaming\Stand\Lua Scripts" folder.

# Credits
I am using functions and features from other LUA developers. Since this won't be public, I have not added credits in the Code. I would probably go insane if I would need to give credit to everyone who has helped me or I have taken options & Ideas from. If you are unsure about this, look at the commits. Though, as I am quite late with 'em, some may existed before others had it.

So my thanks go out to everyone, especially:
- Prisuhm
- Sapphire
- Kodama
- Jerry
- Aarroonn
- Wiri
- Davuwus
- And everyone in the [#programming](<https://discord.com/channels/956618713157763072/956618713581387806>) Channel.
