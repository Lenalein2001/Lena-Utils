# Lena-Utils
A Lua Script to enhance the User's Gameplay.

# Installation
To install, simply click "Download ZIP" and extract the .zip. Copy and Paste everything into the "%AppData%\Roaming\Stand\Lua Scripts" folder.

# Credits
I am using functions from other LUA developers. Since this won't be public I have not added credits in the Code. I would probably go insane if I would need to give credit to everyone who has helped me.
So my thanks go out to everyone, especially:
- Prisuhm
- Sapphire
- Kodama
- Jerry
- Aarroonn
- Wiri
- And everyone in the #programming Channel
